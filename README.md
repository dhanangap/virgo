# Virgo
Virgo is a JavaScript library built to help developing modern web applications faster and easier.

## Getting Started

First, you need to include the bundled CSS file inside `<head>` tag:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@bahtera/virgo/dist/virgo.bundle.min.css">
```
Then, include the bundled JS file just before the closing of `</body>` tag:
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@bahtera/virgo/dist/virgo.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
Virgo is ready to launch.
