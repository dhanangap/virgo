# Virgo
Virgo is a JavaScript library built to help developing modern web applications faster and easier.

## Getting Started

First, you need to include the bundled CSS file inside `<head>` tag:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@bahtera/virgo/dist/virgo.bundle.min.css">
```
Then, include the bundled JS file just before the closing of `</body>` tag:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@bahtera/virgo/dist/virgo.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
Virgo is ready to launch.

## Usage

Using Virgo is easy. If you know HTML, then you know Virgo. It leverages your knowledge about Web and its technology and doesn't try to force you to learn new concepts.

For example, to create a datepicker input inside a form with default configuration, you can do it with basic and valid HTML:

```html
<form>
	<input type="datepicker" name="birthdate" data-label="Your Birthdate">
</form>
```

That script will transform standard HTML date input and provide datepicker component that works accross the browsers. `data-label` attribute is optional, but it will give you a label above the input box â€“automagically.
